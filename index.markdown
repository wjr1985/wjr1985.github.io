title: Hunting for the perfect web browser
layout: page
---

I've been on the hunt for a browser for a while that solves the following needs:

- Supports Android, Mac, Windows, and Linux
- Has Extension support on all the above
- Has syncing across all running browsers
- Supports keyboard shortcuts on Android tablets
- Has ad-blocking
- Successfully blocks Admiral-based websites

Despite those 4 requirements, it's been oddly hard to find a browser that matches everything above. So, I decided to create a table to show where things are at now across the various browers I've tested.

## The Results
